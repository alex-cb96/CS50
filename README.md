#### DESCRIPTION:
The project goal is to do some data analytics and visualization on **"IMDB (Image Movies Data Base) TOP 1000 Movies"** dataset. 

The language used is Python, including state of the art libraries such as *"pandas"*, *"matplotlib"*, *"seaborn"*, *"wordcloud"*, "nltk"*. The IDE used is *Jupyter Lab*.

The dataset was provided in form of CSV and was transformed and manipulated using pandas library.

The useful information that I've managed to extract and visualize was:
* The most successful year in movie industry
* The most successful main actor
* The most successful secondary actor
* The most successful director
* The most common words in movies "Overview"
* The most common movie genres
* Dependencies between IMDB_Rating, Meta_Score & No_of_Votes

<u>bonus</u>: 
* Sentiment analysis on "Movie Overview" section

Used different visualization types such as bar charts, heat maps and word clouds.

Sentiment analysis has been peformed using *"nltk"* library and helped to identify that most overviews has "negative" sentiment, a fact that is also confirmed by high number of Dramas in the list.
